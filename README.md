## Code for: Single-cell ionic current phenotyping elucidates non-canonical features and predictive potential of cardiomyocytes during automated drug experiments

Figures from the [published manuscript](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP285120) can be plotted by running the files titled fX-\*, where the X is a number between 1 and 10.

Data can be downloaded from [10.6084/m9.figshare.25979284](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25979284). The files titled `dmso_cells.zip`, `flecainide_cells.zip`, and `quinine_cells.zip` must be unzipped and the containing files added to a directory with the following structure: `./data/cells/`. The other files can be unzipped directly in a `./data` folder.
